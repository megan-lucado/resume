## Projects 
> _These projects reside in my private repository to uphold academic policies as they were developed as part of my college coursework_

**Early Identification of At-Risk Students Through Predictive Modeling | _December 2024_**
- Developed and evaluated predictive models using Linear, Lasso, and Support Vector Machine Regression to forecast student performance, achieving 78% accuracy and a 2.13-point margin of error. Preprocessed data via pipelines and feature engineering, combining correlated variables and imputing missing values. Optimized models for performance and scalability, enabling early identification of at-risk students. Documented methodologies, results, and actionable insights to support production implementation, improving academic intervention strategies through advanced machine learning techniques.
- **_Technologies Used:_** Python (including libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

**CMS BRFSS Logistic Regression Model	| _October 2024_**
- Used CMS’s 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to develop a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of depressive disorder based on gender. Males were the reference group, and the results show that females have 127.8% higher odds of having a depressive disorder compared to males (OR = 2.28).
- **_Technologies Used:_** R (including packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, lsr, readr)

**Health Information Management (HIM) Excel Dashboard	| _April 2024_**
- Developed an excel dashboard that demonstrates the volume of documentation being received by the image processing department. The dashboard was used to determine staff needs as Wellstar MCG Health completes their merger.
- **_Technologies Used:_** Excel, PowerPoint, PowerChart
